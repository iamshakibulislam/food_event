        "Heat olive oil in a deep skillet. Add onion and saute over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes. Add pumpkin, butternut squash, carrots, parsnip, and turnip. Season with salt and pepper. Stir to combine. Cook for 5 minutes, uncovered, stirring occasionally.",
        "Add thyme, rosemary, sage, parsley, and bay leaves to the pot, tucking the sprigs down into the vegetables so they can release their oils. Add garlic and continue to stir occasionally. Be careful not to let the garlic burn. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 5 minutes.",
        "Heat vegetable stock in a separate pot. Add all the vegetables from the skillet. Check seasoning and adjust if necessary. Simmer until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Retrieve all herb sprigs. Serve as is or allow soup to cool and blend in a blender to desired consistency."
