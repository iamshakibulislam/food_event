        "Combine flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt, oil, and wine in a stand mixer. Mix ingredients using the paddle attachment until a ball forms. Switch to the dough hook and knead dough for 10 minutes.",
        "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat and add the remaining salt. Spread a large, clean cloth out on a counter or table.",
        "Pinch off a walnut-sized piece of dough once kneading has finished. Roll dough piece into a snake about 2 1/2 inches long. Form a tear drop shape, lightly pressing the two ends together to seal them into a ring. Repeat with remaining dough.",
        "Turn down the boiling water to a low boil. Drop taralli into the water a few at a time. Do not stir; they will sink at first, then begin to float. Remove floating taralli with a slotted spoon. Place them on the clean cloth and continue until all the taralli have boiled and are drained on the cloth. Place them on the prepared baking sheet.",
        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until taralli are golden and firm on the outside, but still soft on the inside, about 40 minutes. Cool completely and rest for at least 1 hour before serving. Wrap with a clean cloth or place in a paper bag; store at room temperature for up to 1 week."
