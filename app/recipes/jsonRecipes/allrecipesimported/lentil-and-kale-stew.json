        "Cut stems off the kale and mince. Chop leaves into pinky finger-sized strips.",
        "Heat olive oil in a soup pot over medium heat. Saute onion until soft and starting to brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Grind fresh salt and pepper over the onion. Add black and red lentils; toss with onion to coat.",
        "Stir in vegetable broth, cumin, and cayenne. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and add kale stems and leaves. Simmer until lentils are tender and broth is largely absorbed, about 20 minutes. Squeeze in lemon juice. Sample stew and adjust cumin, cayenne, and pepper until it has a complex, full-flavored taste."
