        "Rinse split mung dahl beans and drain. Place in a medium-large saucepan over high heat and add enough water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cover. Simmer, splashing in more water if lentils get too dry, until softened, about 1 hour.",
        "Meanwhile, heat oil in a small saucepan over medium  heat. Add cumin seeds and fry until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add asafoetida and cook until browned, about 10 seconds. Stir in tomatoes and 1/2 to 1 cup water, scraping any browned bits off the bottom. Add coriander, Aleppo pepper, and turmeric. Cover and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in spinach, cover, and cook until bright green, about 5 minutes.",
        "Remove lentils from heat. Drain excess water but leave 1/4 to 1/2 cup. Stir in the spinach mixture and return pan to medium-low heat. Mix in lemon juice, sea salt, and garam masala. Simmer until desired consistency is reached, 5 to 10 minutes more."
