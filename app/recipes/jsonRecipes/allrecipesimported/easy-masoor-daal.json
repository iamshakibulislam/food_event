        "Rinse lentils thoroughly and place in a medium saucepan along with ginger, turmeric, salt and cayenne pepper.  Cover with about 1 inch of water and bring to a boil.  Skim off any foam that forms on top of the lentils.  Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until beans are tender and soupy.",
        "Meanwhile, in a microwave safe dish combine oil, dried onion and cumin seeds.  Microwave on high for 45 seconds to 1 minute; be sure to brown, but not burn, onions.  Stir into lentil mixture."
