        "Combine olive oil and salt in a small bowl.",
        "Divide dough into 4 equal portions and shape each into a smooth ball. Coat a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. Place dough balls into prepared pan and brush with about 1/2 the oil mixture, reserving the rest. Cover loosely with oiled plastic wrap and let rise until loaf fills the pan and mushrooms over it, about 1 hour more.",

        "Brush remaining oil mixture on top of the loaf.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes."
