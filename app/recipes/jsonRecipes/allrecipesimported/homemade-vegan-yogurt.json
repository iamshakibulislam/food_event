Add, one at a time, the agar agar, xanthan gum, ground soy lecithin granules, and soy-sunflower lecithin, whisking vigorously after each addition. Blend using an electric mixer until well combined. Continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the yogurt mixture reads 90 to 115 degrees F (32 to 46 degrees C), about 5 minutes.",
