        "Inspect peas, discarding any stones, foreign matter, or unattractive peas. Place peas in a fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water to remove pea dust.",
        "Transfer drained peas into a pot with a lid and a heavy, heat-diffusing bottom. Add water, onion, celery, ketchup, olive oil, salt, garlic, and bay leaves. Cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to a very slow simmer. Cook, stirring and scraping the bottom every 7 to 12 minutes, until peas have largely fallen apart, about 1 1/2 hours.",
        "Stir carrots into the soup. Cook, covered, stirring often, until peas are completely dissolved and soup is thick, about 1 1/2 hours more. Remove and discard bay leaves. Season with pepper."
