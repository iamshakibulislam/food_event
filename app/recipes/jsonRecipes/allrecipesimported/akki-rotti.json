        "In a mixing bowl, combine the mung beans, rice flour, cumin seeds, green chile, asafoetida, cilantro, coconut, shredded carrot, and salt. Gradually add the water, mixing well with your hands to form a workable dough. Use only as much water as needed (about 1/2 cup).",
        "Shape the dough into balls about the size of a tennis ball. Set aside. Flatten one portion of dough into a thin round.",

Flip the rotti over and fry until golden. Repeat with the remaining dough, adding 2 tablespoons of oil to the griddle for each rotti. Serve hot."
