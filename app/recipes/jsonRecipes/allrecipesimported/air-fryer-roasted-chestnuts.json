        "Wash and dry the chestnuts. Place flat side down on a cutting board. Using a paring knife, score a large \u201cX\u201d in the rounded side, covering at least half of the chestnut. Make sure the knife goes through the outer skin and the brown layer underneath. This will aid peeling after being roasted.",
        "Soak chestnuts in the hot water for 1 to 5 minutes, depending on how big the chestnuts are. Remove chestnuts with a slotted spoon and immediately place them in the air fryer basket. Place 1 cup hot water inside the basket.",
        "Cook for 10 minutes. Shake well. Check to see if there is still water inside. If not, add another 1/2 cup. Continue cooking until the shells have peeled away and exposed flesh has browned, 5 to 10 minutes more. Remove and allow to cool enough to be handled. Peel away the shells."
