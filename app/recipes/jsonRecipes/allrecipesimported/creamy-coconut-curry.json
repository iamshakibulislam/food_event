        "Melt coconut butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic using a wooden spoon until translucent and lightly brown in color, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt, cumin, pepper, fennel seeds, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala; mix until well incorporated. Stir in corn starch until a creamy paste forms.",
        "Slowly mix water into the saucepan to dissolve cornstarch and thicken the mixture. Keep stirring until there are no lumps. Stir in chickpeas and broccoli and briefly cook until just lightly crisp and tender (do not overcook). Mix in coconut cream and curry leaves and cover pan halfway with a lid. Simmer until liquid is reduced and has thickened, 2 to 3 minutes.",
        "Remove lid and lower heat to medium-low. Cook and stir until liquid is reduced and curry is thick and creamy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add bok choy and cook until wilted and curry has further reduced, 3 to 5 minutes."
