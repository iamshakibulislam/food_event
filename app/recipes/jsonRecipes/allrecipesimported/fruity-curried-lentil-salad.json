        "Pour the pineapple juice into a measuring pitcher, and add enough water to make 2 cups. Set the pineapple chunks aside. Pour the pineapple juice into a saucepan, and stir in the quinoa and lentils. Season with salt, black pepper, and curry powder. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the lentils and quinoa have absorbed the water, about 30 minutes. Stir in the coconut, and simmer for 5 minutes more.",
