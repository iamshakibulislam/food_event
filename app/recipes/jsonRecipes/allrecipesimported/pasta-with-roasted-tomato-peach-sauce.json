        "Broil for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, turning every 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. When cool enough to handle, remove and discard skins on onion and garlic cloves. Transfer all vegetables, peach halves, and any juices to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until a smooth puree forms.",

        "Add pasta to tomato sauce with 1/2 cup reserved cooking liquid. Cook until pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, adding more liquid if necessary, 3 to 5 minutes more."
