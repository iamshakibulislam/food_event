        "Place dates in a small bowl and completely cover with hot water. Allow to soak until softened, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain, but reserve soaking liquid.",
        "Combine soaked dates, 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds, walnuts, almonds, coconut, coconut oil, cardamom, cinnamon, vanilla, and salt in the bowl of a large food processor. Pulse several times until mixture comes together to form a soft \"dough,\" scraping down the sides as necessary. If mixture is too dry, add in some of the reserved soaking liquid, 1 tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is reached.",
        "Turn out dough onto a piece of parchment paper. Roll into a 10-inch long by 1 1/2-inch wide log using lightly greased hands. Sprinkle remaining toasted sesame seeds evenly over the log on all sides, pressing them in gently. Wrap the log in parchment paper, and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 to 2 hours.",
        "Remove log from fridge, and cut into about sixteen 1/2-inch thick rounds. Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator until ready to use."
