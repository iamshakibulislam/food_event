        "Combine 2 cups water, rice, and a pinch of salt in a saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and cover. Simmer, stirring occasionally to prevent rice from sticking, until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Fluff with a fork; cool rice until easily handled, about 10 minutes.",
        "Fill a small bowl with water. Place 2 tablespoons of salt in another small bowl.",
        "Dip hands in water and rub salt over hands. Take a handful of warm rice and form it into a ball. Gently squish ball; with your hands in an \"L\" or \"C\" shape, apply gentle pressure to the sides to make a triangle shape.",
        "Wrap a strip of nori around the triangle, using a bit of water to help it stick if necessary."
