        "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil.",
        "Remove the outer layers of the fennel but leave the fronds. Wash with water. Cut into eighths. Scrub carrots under running water, leaving about 4 inches of the green tops. If your carrots are larger than 3/4-inch in diameter, cut them in half.",
        "Arrange the vegetables on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle Sriracha salt evenly over the vegetables.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until the vegetables are tender but not too soft, 20 and 25 minutes. Turn on the broiler and brown the vegetables for about 2 minutes. Serve warm."
