        "Add the potatoes to a large saucepan and cover with cold water by at least 1 inch. Add the salt and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, partially covered, until the potatoes are very tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Drain and return the potatoes to the pan.",
        "Break up the potatoes with a potato masher or a handheld mixer on low speed. Gradually add Country Crock\u00ae Spread and beat until incorporated. Gradually add the cream cheese, and sour cream, beating well after each addition.",
        "Gradually stir in the warm half-and-half, 2 tablespoons at a time, until well incorporated and the potatoes are fluffy and light (you may not need all the half-and-half). Stir in the thyme and season to taste with salt and pepper. Top with remaining tablespoon Country Crock\u00ae Spread."
