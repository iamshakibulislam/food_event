        "Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl. Add banana mixture, stirring just enough to moisten. Fold in walnuts. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean, 60 to 65 minutes. Let bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack."
