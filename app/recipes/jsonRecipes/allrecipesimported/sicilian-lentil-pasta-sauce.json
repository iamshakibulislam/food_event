        "In a large saucepan, heat oil over medium heat.  Add onions, mushrooms, zucchini, and garlic.  Cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes.",
        "Add lentils and 3 cups water to vegetables.  Bring to a rolling boil, stirring occasionally.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook 45 to 60 minutes.",
        "Stir in tomato sauce, tomato paste, sugar, and 1/2 cup water.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.  If necessary, add more water to keep the sauce from sticking.  Be careful not to dilute; the sauce should be quite thick."
