        "Remove greens from carrots and then remove and discard as much of the stems as possible, keeping only the leaves. Chop leaves to about 1/2 inch. Reserve carrots for another use.",
        "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; parboil greens for 2 minutes then strain and shock in ice water. Drain and squeeze dry. Place in a new bowl of cold water and refrigerate for 8 hours, or overnight, changing water 1 to 2 times during the process to help eliminate extra bitter flavor. Drain and squeeze again.",
        "Mix sesame seeds, vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce, and sugar together in a medium bowl. Toss in carrot greens and almonds and mix well.",
        "Cover greens and refrigerate to marinate at least 1 hour before serving."
