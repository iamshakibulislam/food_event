        "Soak chickpeas in plenty of cold water for 8 hours to overnight. Drain. Place in a saucepan and cover with fresh water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cook, covered, until soft, about 1 hour.",
        "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix carrots with 1 tablespoon olive oil and spread on a baking sheet.",
        "Bake until softened and lightly browned, about 25 minutes. Let cool.",
        "Drain chickpeas and reserve cooking liquid. When chickpeas are cool enough to handle, slip off skins - this is easiest if you keep them immersed in warm water.",
        "Place drained peeled chickpeas into the bowl of a food processor. Add roasted carrots, garlic, tahini, harissa, sun-dried tomatoes, lemon juice, and lemon olive oil. Process until smooth, scraping down sides of bowl. Salt to taste. Add more lemon juice and/or cooking water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if hummus is too stiff.",
        "Transfer hummus to a container with a tight-fitting lid and drizzle olive oil on top. Cover and refrigerate. Use within 5 to 7 days."
