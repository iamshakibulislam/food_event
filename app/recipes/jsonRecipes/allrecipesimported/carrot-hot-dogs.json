        "Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add carrots, cover, and steam until tender yet still have a snap, about 15 minutes. Run cold water over carrots to stop the cooking process. Transfer carrots to a storage container.",
        "Whisk soy sauce, water, vinegar, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, and black pepper together in a bowl; pour over carrots. Cover container and refrigerate, at least 3 hours. The longer they marinate, the more intense to flavor.",
        "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.",
        "Remove carrots from marinade and place on the grill; cook until desired doneness is reached, 5 to 10 minutes."
