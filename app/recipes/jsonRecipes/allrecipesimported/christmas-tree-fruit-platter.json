        "Create an outline of a tree shape using the grapes on a cutting board or serving platter. Begin at the top point of the tree and fan the grapes out into a triangular pattern. Create 3 triangular sections, each slightly larger than the last. Fill in each section with kiwi slices.",
        "Arrange sliced strawberries across the tree shape to create a garland effect. Add pomegranate seeds randomly all over the arranged fruit to look like ornaments.",
        "Place pineapple slices onto a cutting board. Use small cookie cutters to cut out a star shape and some several small ornament shapes. Place the star at the top of the tree shape, and decorate the rest of the tree with the pineapple ornaments.",
        "Arrange dates at the bottom of the tree to look like a trunk. Serve immediately, or keep refrigerated until ready to serve."
