        "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
        "Slice a small piece off the round part of each potato half, so they sit flat on a surface with the large flat sides facing upwards. Score the flat sides in a diamond pattern, cutting down about 1/2 inch and being careful not to cut all the way through.",
        "Drizzle 1/2 of the oil over the diamond cuts, sprinkle with 1/2 of the paprika, and season with salt. Place potatoes, seasoned side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle the other side with the remaining oil, paprika, and salt.",
        "Roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Flip potatoes and roast until cooked through, about 30 more minutes."
