        "Pour water into a large saucepan. Drop konbu into the water. Bring to a simmer; the water will start sucking in the essence of the konbu. Add soy sauce, mirin, and sake. Simmer, tasting from time to time, about 5 minutes. Remove konbu and let cool completely. Pour into a bottle, seal, and store inside a refrigerator. Use as soon as possible."
