        "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and reserve 1 cup of cooking water.",
        "Heat 4 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet. Add chile and garlic; stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in 1/4 cup reserved pasta water and stir. Add drained pasta to the skillet and toss. Add extra pasta water if needed to keep the spaghetti moist but not soggy. Mix in parsley. Toss again and plate. Top with remaining olive oil, if desired. Serve immediately."
