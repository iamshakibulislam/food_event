        "Soak oats in enough cool water to cover them. Cover and set aside for 30 minutes.",
        "Drain the oats using a mesh colander. Combine oats, 3 cups water, and dates in a large bowl. Allow to sit undisturbed until skin on the dates softens, 10 to 15 minutes.",
        "Transfer oat mixture to a blender. Pulse the mixture a few times and then leave on medium-high speed until completely smooth, about 1 minute. Drain oat milk through a nut bag or cheesecloth to remove all solids. Serve cold or warm."
