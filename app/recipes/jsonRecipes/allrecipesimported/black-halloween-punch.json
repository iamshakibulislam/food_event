        "To make a frozen hand, wash a disposable glove, fill with water, seal with a rubber band and freeze until hard.",
        "Stir together grape soft drink mix, orange soft drink mix, sugar and water until solids are dissolved.  Combine with chilled ginger ale just before serving.  Dip the frozen hand briefly in warm water, then peel off the glove.  Float the prepared hand in the punch bowl for a ghastly effect."
