    "directions": [
        "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking pan with parchment paper or a nonstick silicone baking mat, such as SILPAT\u2122.",
        "Whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Cut in vegan butter and coconut oil with a pastry blender or a fork until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.",
        "Slowly add cold almond milk and stir until dough just comes together. It may not be necessary to use all the milk; dough will be wet and sticky.",
        "Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead (fold over) 15 times. Gently roll or pat dough to a 1- or 1 1/2-inch thickness. Cut biscuits with a small biscuit cutter or a small bourbon glass. Gently re-roll the dough scraps and cut remaining biscuits.",
        "Place biscuits on the prepared baking sheet. Be sure they are touching each other and the sides of the pan; don't be afraid to squish them in--this helps them to rise high.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until tops are golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes."
