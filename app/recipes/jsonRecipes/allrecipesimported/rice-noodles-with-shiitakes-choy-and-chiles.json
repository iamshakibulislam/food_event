        "In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, sake or sherry, vinegar, sugar, water and cornstarch. In a large skillet or wok heat the oils over high heat. When the oil is nearly smoking, add the garlic and hot peppers. Take the skillet or wok off the heat after 10 seconds.",
        "Reduce the heat to medium-high and return the skillet or wok to the heat. Add the ginger, bok choy, shiitakes, and green onions; cook for 3 minutes over high heat, stirring constantly. Add the fresh or soaked rice noodles and the soy sauce mixture; cook 2 minutes more or until the noodles are hot and tender. Serve the noodles immediately, topped with the toasted sesame seeds."
