        "Rinse quinces under running water to remove the fuzzy layer. Squeeze the lemon into a large bowl and fill halfway with water.",
        "Cut quinces into quarters. Peel, core, and dice one quarter at a time, and transfer fruit to the lemon water to prevent browning.",
        "Combine 3 cups of fresh water, cane sugar, agave syrup, cinnamon stick, and cardamom pod in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add drained quinces and reduce heat to medium-high. Cook at a low boil for 20 minutes.",
        "Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover the saucepan with a lid, placing a wooden spoon underneath to keep it slightly ajar and allow some steam to escape without it drying out. Simmer like this for about 25 minutes. The compote is ready when the fruit has turned a red blush color, it is tender to a fork, and the syrup has reduced by three-fourths. The objective is to have softened fruit with a thickened syrup at the end. The syrup will thicken more upon cooling."
