        "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Whisk oil, vinegar, mustard, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl.",
        "Remove any loose outer leaves from the cabbage. Trim the stem so the cabbage sits flat on a cutting board. Cut vertically into six 3/4-inch-thick \"steaks\". Place the steaks on a baking sheet.",
        "Brush one side of the steaks with some of the oil mixture.",
        "Place the steaks on the grill, oiled-side down; close the lid and grill for 5 minutes. Brush more oil mixture on top and gently flip over; close lid and grill until tender-crisp and slightly charred, 5 to 7 minutes more. Remove to a platter and drizzle with any remaining oil mixture."
