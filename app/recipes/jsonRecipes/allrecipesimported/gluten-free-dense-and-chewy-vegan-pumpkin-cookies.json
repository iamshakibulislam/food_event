        "Heat pumpkin puree in a saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally, until condensed to about 1/2 cup, about 20 minutes. Let cool, at least 10 minutes.",
        "Beat brown sugar, shortening, and white sugar together until smooth and creamy. Add the cooled pumpkin and vanilla extract; blend well. Sprinkle in oat flour, tapioca flour, brown rice flour, guar gum, cinnamon, and salt. Add cranberries and pumpkin seeds. Mix until dough is very stiff and dry; it should not stick to your hands. Add more flour, 2 tablespoons at a time, if needed.",

        "Place golf-ball size balls of dough on the prepared baking sheet. Press tops down slightly.",
