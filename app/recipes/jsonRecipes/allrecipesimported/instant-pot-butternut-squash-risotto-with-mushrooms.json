        "Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot\u00ae) and select Saute function. Add olive oil when the pot is hot.

Saute, stirring occasionally, until squash is browned on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes.",
        "Push squash mixture to the side of the pot. Add rice and stir to coat. Saute, stirring frequently, until starting to stick to the bottom of the pot, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour wine into the pot and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits off the bottom with a wooden spoon.",
        "Pour vegetable broth, mushrooms, red bell pepper, salt, nutmeg, and the rest of the squash into the pot. Stir; close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.",
