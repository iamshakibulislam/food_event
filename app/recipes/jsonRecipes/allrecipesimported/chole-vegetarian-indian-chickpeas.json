        "Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, and anise; stir. Add chickpeas, tomato sauce, water, chile powder, garam masala, salt, cumin, coriander, turmeric, and clove. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, until chickpeas start to soften, 5 to 7 minutes.",
        "Mash some of the chickpeas directly in the pot to give the sauce a chunkier consistency. Cover and continue simmering, stirring occasionally, until flavors come together, about 15 minutes. Remove star anise pieces and clove before serving."
