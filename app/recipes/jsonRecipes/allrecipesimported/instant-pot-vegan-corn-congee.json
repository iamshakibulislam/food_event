        "Rinse rice under cool running water until the water runs clear. Place rice in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot\u00ae) and add 6 cups of vegetable broth.",
        "Cut corn kernels off the cob and break cob into 3 pieces. Place kernels, cob pieces, and ginger in the pot with rice and broth. Close and lock the lid. Select Porridge function and set timer for 30 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.",
        "Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 15 minutes.  Unlock and remove the lid. Check consistency of congee. If you want a thinner congee, add the remaining 1 cup broth, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the desired thinness is reached. Remove corn cob pieces and season with salt and white pepper; stir well.",
        "Divide congee into 6 bowls. Top with even amounts of sliced spring onions, whole peanuts, crushed peanuts, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and chili crisp."
