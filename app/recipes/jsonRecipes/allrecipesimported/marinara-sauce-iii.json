        "In a saucepan saute onion and garlic over medium-low heat until they start to become clear.  Combine in a pot,  diced tomatoes, carrots, celery, red bell pepper, mushrooms, oregano, parsley, basil and olive oil.  Bring to boil and reduce heat to medium-low.  Simmer for at least 1 hour, however, 3 hours of cooking develops better flavor and consistency."
