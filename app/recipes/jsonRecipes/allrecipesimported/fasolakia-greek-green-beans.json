        "Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat and stir in onion. Cook until onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Add green beans and stir to coat in the oil. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes. Add pureed tomato, potatoes, salt, pepper, and sugar. Stir well, then add water until beans are barely covered.",
        "Bring to a simmer, partially cover with a lid, and cook gently over medium-low heat until green beans and potatoes are soft, 25 to 30 minutes. Uncover towards the end of cooking to reduce sauce if it is too watery."
