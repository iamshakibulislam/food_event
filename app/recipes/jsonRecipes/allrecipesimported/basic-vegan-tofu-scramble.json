        "Place tofu onto a plate and place another plate on top. Set a 3- to 5-pound weight on top. Press tofu for 20 to 30 minutes; drain and discard the accumulated liquid. Squeeze tofu with your hands to break it into crumbles into a bowl.",
        "Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat and cook tofu for 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat and mix in mustard and 1/2 the nutritional yeast. Stir well to scramble. Gradually mix remaining nutritional yeast into the tofu. Add more oil if nutritional yeast is not sticking to the tofu. Stir turmeric into the tofu and season with salt and pepper."
