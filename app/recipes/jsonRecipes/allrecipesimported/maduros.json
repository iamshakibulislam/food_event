        "Heat approximately 1/4 inch of oil, or just enough for plantain slices to be halfway submerged, in a medium skillet over medium heat.",
        "Cut off the ends of the plantains. Slit the skin of each plantain by running the tip of your knife from one end of the \"rib\" to the other; peel the skin. Cut at an angle, making slices that are about 3/4-inch thick.",
        "Brown plantain slices in the hot oil until brown, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and place on a paper towel-covered plate to drain off excess oil. Sprinkle with salt while still moist."
