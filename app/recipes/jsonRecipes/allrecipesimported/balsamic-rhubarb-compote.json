        "Place chopped rhubarb in a medium-sized saucepan. Add sugar, balsamic vinegar, and salt; stir to coat rhubarb evenly. Let sit for 10 minutes until rhubarb has released its juices.",
        "Bring rhubarb mixture to a light boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until rhubarb is soft and mixture has thickened, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. Mixture will further thicken upon cooling. Place in a jar or storage container and refrigerate for up to a week."
