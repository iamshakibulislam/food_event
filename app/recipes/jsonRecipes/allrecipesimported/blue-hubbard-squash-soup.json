        "Cut the squash in half. Remove the seeds and place the squash cut side-down on a baking sheet.",
        "Roast in the preheated oven until you can pierce a fork through the flesh of the squash, about 40 minutes. Do not overcook it so it becomes mushy. Set aside.",
        "Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more.",
        "Peel off the skin from the squash or use a spoon to scoop out the flesh. Add squash to the pot, cover with vegetable broth, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook, about 15 minutes.",
        "Turn off heat and remove the lid. Stir in coconut milk and lemon juice and allow to cool slightly, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a blender in batches, or use an immersion blender, to blend the soup until it is silky smooth."
