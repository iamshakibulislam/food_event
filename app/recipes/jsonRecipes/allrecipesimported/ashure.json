        "When the wheat has thickened, stir in the sugar and bring the mixture to a boil. Drain the cooked beans and add them to the wheat mixture. Stir in the raisins, apricots, orange peel, and cloves. Reduce the heat and simmer until the mixture thickens and the fruit is tender, about 15 minutes.",
