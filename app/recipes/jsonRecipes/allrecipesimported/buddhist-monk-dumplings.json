        "Place potato into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and mash. Set aside to cool.",
        "Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds and stir. Add carrots, onion, green chile, garlic, turmeric, and ginger. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Add mashed potato, cabbage, and tofu and stir again. Add water and cilantro; cook and stir until vegetables are soft and water is dried up, 7 to 8 minutes. Add garam masala and salt and stir well. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.",
        "Mix flour, water, and salt together in a bowl. Knead into a ball; continue kneading until dough is very soft, 10 to 12 minutes. Wrap and rest for at least 1 hour.",
        "Take a knob of dough and roll out into small round, about 4 inches in diameter. Spoon a heaped teaspoon of filling in the center and moisten the edge with a little water. Press edges together, overlapping the top slightly to form a pleat, and continue to create a half-moon shape with little pleats all around the edge. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.",
        "Fit a large pan with a steamer basket and add about 2 inches of water. Bring to a boil. Add dumplings and steam until swollen and cooked through, about 15 minutes."
