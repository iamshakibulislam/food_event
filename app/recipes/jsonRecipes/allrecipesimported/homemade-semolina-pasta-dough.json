        "Mix flour and salt in a large bowl or on a marble work surface. Make a well in the center.",
        "Pour water into the well a little at a time, mixing it with the flour. Add as much water as needed to make a sticky but compact dough.",
        "Knead dough with your hands by flattening the ball, stretching it, and folding the top towards the center. Turn 45 degrees and repeat until dough is elastic and smooth, but not too soft, about 10 minutes.",
        "Shape dough into a ball. Place in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes before using.",
        "Roll out the dough with a pasta machine or with a rolling pin and cut into your favorite shapes."
