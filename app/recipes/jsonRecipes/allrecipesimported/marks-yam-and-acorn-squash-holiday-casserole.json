        "Bake in the preheated oven until the acorn squash and yam is tender, about 45 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, combine the balsamic vinegar, apricot jam, and pomegranate juice in a saucepan. Stir in the roasted pepper, garlic, ginger, and five-spice powder. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the sauce has reduced to half of its original volume, about 15 minutes. Whisk in the rice flour and coconut milk. Return to a simmer, and cook 10 minutes longer. Keep warm.",
        "When the squash is tender, drain off the water and place the yams in a mixing bowl. Scrape the squash into the bowl, and mash with the yams until smooth. Add the roasted pepper sauce, and continue mashing until well combined. Scrape into a serving dish, and sprinkle with chopped walnuts. Garnish with pomegranate seeds and fresh basil to serve."
