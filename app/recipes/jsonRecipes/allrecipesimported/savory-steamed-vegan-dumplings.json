        "Combine warm water and yeast in a small bowl and allow to sit until frothy, 10 to 15 minutes. Place mushrooms and tomatoes in a bowl and cover with warm water; let stand for 5 minutes. Drain mushrooms and tomatoes, chop coarsely, and set aside.",
        "Combine flour and cane sugar together in a large bowl. Add yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir well until mixture becomes kneadable; knead until well-blended. Add another 1 or 2 tablespoons of water only if needed to make dough moist enough. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead well for 5 minutes.",
        "Grease a bowl with olive oil. Form dough into a ball and place in the bowl; roll around to coat with oil. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and allow dough to rise in a warm place for 1 hour.",
        "While dough rises, heat canola oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until lightly golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Add green onions and cook for 1 minute. Add celery and cook for 1 minute. Add drained and chopped mushrooms and tomatoes; cook for 1 minute. Add zucchini and cook for 1 minute. Add bok choy and cook for 1 minute. Add spinach and cover the pan. Cook until wilted, 3 to 5 minutes.",
        "While vegetables cook, combine miso paste, tamari, and liquid aminos in a bowl. Add mixture to the saucepan with the vegetables and mix well. Remove saucepan from heat and allow dumpling filling to cool until safe to handle, 10 to 15 minutes.",
        "Punch dough down in the bowl; let rest 15 minutes more. Transfer dough to a floured work surface and roll into a 12-inch log. Cut log into 24 even pieces. Use a rolling pin to roll each piece into a 3-inch circle.",
        "Put 1 heaping teaspoon filling in the center of each dough circle. Bring edges up like a pouch, twist, and press down gently to seal.",
        "Place a wet paper towel or a cabbage leaf inside a steamer insert and arrange dumplings on top. Allow dumplings to rise for 15 minutes.",
        "Place steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Steam dumplings until they appear shiny, 10 to 12 minutes."
