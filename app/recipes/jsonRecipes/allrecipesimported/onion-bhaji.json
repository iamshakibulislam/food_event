        "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook onions until soft and translucent without browning them, about 5 minutes.",
        "Add turmeric, coriander, cumin, ginger, and chili powder and stir in evenly until onions take on a uniform color. Remove from heat.",
        "Put onions in a mixing bowl. Combine flour, garam masala, salt, coriander, garlic, turmeric, cumin, and saffron in a small bowl. Add spice mix to the onions and mix until well coated. Stir water and tomato paste together in a bowl and pour over onion mixture. Stir everything together. Batter should be easy to stir but not sloppy or sticky. Add more water, 1 teaspoon at a time, if batter is too sticky.",
        "Heat oil in a large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add a large spoonful of batter to the hot oil and deep fry for 30 to 45 seconds. Turn bhaji over and fry until golden brown and crispy, another 30 seconds. Remove and drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining batter."
