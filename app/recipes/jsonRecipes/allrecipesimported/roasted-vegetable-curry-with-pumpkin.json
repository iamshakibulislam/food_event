        "Meanwhile, place cauliflower florets in a saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Cook until soft but still firm, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, run under cold water, and drain. Set aside.",
        "Heat remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and fry until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add bell pepper and garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Add curry powder, cumin, coriander, and turmeric; cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly to prevent burning. Add tomato puree and sugar and bring to a boil. Lower heat slightly, and simmer until sauce reduces, adding water as needed to maintain a thick consistency, about 20 minutes.",
        "Add reserved cauliflower and roasted vegetables to the reduced sauce, stirring carefully so vegetables maintain their shape. Heat until cauliflower is warm, 2 to 3 minutes."
