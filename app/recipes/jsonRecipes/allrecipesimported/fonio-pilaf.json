        "Heat oil in a deep skillet over medium heat. Cook shallot, garlic, black sesame seeds, carrots, and almonds until fragrant and softened, about 4 minutes. Add fonio and stir to absorb flavors, about 2 minutes. Pour in raisins and stock and stir until fonio has absorbed all the liquid, about 5 minutes. Add some remaining stock and cook until the fonio is soft. You may not need the entire amount, depending on the brand and quality of the fonio. Season with salt and pepper.",
