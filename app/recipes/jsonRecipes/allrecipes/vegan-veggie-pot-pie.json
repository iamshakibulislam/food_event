        "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.",
        "Place squash and potatoes on the prepared baking sheet.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Set aside.",
        "Heat olive oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic; saute until onion is translucent, about 7 minutes. Add flour; mix thoroughly. Cook, stirring constantly to prevent burning, until a thick paste is formed, 2 to 3 minutes.",
        "Pour broth into the onion-flour mixture. Whisk vigorously until mixture begins to thicken and comes to a boil, about 7 minutes. Add Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, oregano, and thyme. Pour in water; reduce heat to a simmer. Add the baked squash and potatoes; cook over medium heat until fork-tender, about 10 minutes.",
        "Add frozen vegetables to the broth mixture. Cook until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour mixture into a large baking dish. Roll out the pie dough to fit the baking dish and lay it on top; make a few cuts in the dough to allow steam to escape.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until filling is bubbling and crust is browned, about 30 minutes."
