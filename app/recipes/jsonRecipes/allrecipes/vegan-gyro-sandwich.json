        "Grate cucumber into a colander; place in a sink and allow to drain for 20 minutes. Squeeze out remaining moisture and transfer to a small bowl. Add vegan yogurt, lemon juice, dill, chives, sucanat, salt, and black pepper and stir well. Cover and refrigerate until needed. Stir well before using.",
        "Heat olive oil in a saute pan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook gently until golden, about 1 minute. Add seitan in a single layer, if possible. Brown seitan gently, about 5 minutes. While seitan cooks, blend cumin, oregano, basil, cinnamon, nutmeg, and chili powder together in a bowl. Sprinkle spice mix over browned seitan and toss. Continue browning seitan until heated thoroughly and golden brown, about 5 minutes more.",
        "Assemble a sandwich by layering seitan, tomato, onion, and lettuce on a pita. Spoon sauce on top. Repeat with remaining fillings, sauce, and pita."
