        "Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat. Peel and core apples. Cut them into quarters, then each quarter into 3 pieces. Add apples to the skillet immediately after they are cut.",
        "Add 1/4 cup water, muscovado sugar, jam, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Mix to combine all ingredients and to coat apples evenly. Cover and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Do not open the lid during this time. Shake the skillet to stir around the apples but do not stir them with utensils.",
        "Stir 1 teaspoon water and cornstarch together in a small bowl. Pour slurry into the apples and stir until creamy. Remove from heat. Allow to cool for 5 minutes before serving."
