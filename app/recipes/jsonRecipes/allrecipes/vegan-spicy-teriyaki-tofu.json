        "Heat a medium-sized nonstick pan over medium heat and add sesame oil. When pan is hot, add tofu, 2 tablespoons shoyu, and teriyaki sauce. Cook and stir for a few seconds, then let tofu cook without stirring for 2 minutes. Repeat stirring and cooking without stirring for 6 minutes total. Flip tofu in the pan like flipping a pancake without a spatula and continue cooking until crispy, 5 to 10 minutes more.",
