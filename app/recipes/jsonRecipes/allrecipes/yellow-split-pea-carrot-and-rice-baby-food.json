        "Combine split peas and carrots in a small saucepan and add water to cover by about 2 inches. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer until peas are tender, about 30 minutes. Add additional water as needed so that peas don't stick to the bottom of the pan.",
        "Add rice and 2/3 cup water to the saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook until rice is tender, about 12 minutes.",
        "Remove from heat and add olive oil. Mash or puree to your desired consistency, making it smoother for younger babies or perhaps chunkier for older babies."
