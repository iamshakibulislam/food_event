        "Combine water, soy sauce, and maple syrup in a separate container and mix well. Add to the TVP mixture and combine into a slightly crumbly dough. Mix well to activate gluten and let dough sit for 5 minutes; dough should stiffen slightly and become less crumbly.",

        "Heat oil in a cast iron or nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Cook sausage patties in the hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes on each side."
