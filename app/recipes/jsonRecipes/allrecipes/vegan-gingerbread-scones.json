        "Place flour, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, cream of tartar, baking soda, nutmeg, allspice, and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until just combined, about 30 seconds. Cut chilled coconut oil into 8 pieces; add to flour mixture and pulse until mixture resembles wet sand, about 30 seconds.",
        "Pour wet mixture into food processor and pulse briefly until the dough starts to stick together, about 1 minute. Scrape dough into large bowl. Add pecans and knead 5 or 6 turns to distribute them in the dough.",
        "Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface; cut into 2 equal portions. Pat or roll each portion into a 1-inch thick round. Cut into 8 wedge-shape pieces and place on the prepared baking sheet.",
