        "When chickpeas are halfway done, heat oil in a large pot and cook onions until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add cardamom pods, chile peppers, coriander seeds, turmeric, and mustard seeds and toast for 1 minute. Mix in tomato paste.",
        "Stir butternut squash and carrots into the pot. Add enough water to cover vegetables halfway. Simmer over low heat, partially covered, until all the vegetables are soft, 25 to 35 minutes. Add more water if curry gets too dry.",
