        "While bread is toasting, melt 2 tablespoons margarine in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add mushrooms and onions. Cook until onions are slightly translucent, about 5 minutes. Add a splash of vegetable broth is moisture is needed. Add sage, rosemary, thyme, salt, and black pepper. Cook and stir with a wooden spoon until combined, about 2 minutes more.",
        "Pour mushroom mixture into the bowl with the toasted bread. Toss to evenly distribute. Pour 6 tablespoons melted margarine and vegan broth over the mixture. Add cranberries, apple, and parsley. Mix thoroughly but gently. Spread stuffing into a casserole dish and cover with aluminum foil.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes; check at 25 minutes to prevent burning. Uncover and stir gently. Continue baking until top is browned, about 15 minutes more. Allow to cool slightly before serving."
