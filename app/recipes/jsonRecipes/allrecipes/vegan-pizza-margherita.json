        "Grind oats, rosemary, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder together in a food processor until flourlike in texture.",
        "Place cooled cauliflower in a fine cheesecloth and squeeze out as much moisture as possible. Add pressed cauliflower to the bowl with the flaxseed-water mixture and stir well. Stir in the oat mixture. Form dough into a ball and place onto the lined baking sheet.",
        "Press dough ball down into a circle. Lay a sheet of parchment on top and roll dough flat using a rolling pin to about 1/4-inch thick.",

        "Puree boiled cashews, 1 1/4 cups fresh water, tapioca starch, nutritional yeast, cider vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder in a blender. Pour puree into a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring continuously, until thickened, about 5 minutes.",
        "Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute garlic until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, maple syrup, 1 teaspoon salt, red pepper flakes, oregano, and black pepper. Simmer marinara sauce until flavors blend, about 10 minutes.",
        "Fill blender halfway with marinara sauce. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Pour into a bowl. Repeat with any remaining marinara sauce.",
        "Spread marinara sauce over the cauliflower crust; top with the 'mozzarella cheese' and add cherry tomatoes.",
        "Bake in the hot oven until sauce is bubbling and crust is golden brown, about 8 minutes. Top with basil."
