        "Combine butternut squash, kidney beans, cannellini beans, corn, broth, tomato paste, and serrano peppers in the pot with the tofu mixture. Add allspice, cumin, cayenne pepper, and garlic salt. Add extra broth or water as needed to just cover the vegetable mixture. Bring to a simmer; reduce heat to medium-low and cover.
