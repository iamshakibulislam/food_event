        "Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in oregano, cumin, and chili powder; cook for 1 minute. Add 3 cups vegetable broth, great Northern beans, pinto beans, kale, corn, bulgur wheat, and salt. Return to a simmer.",
        "Transfer roasted garlic, peppers, and tomatillos to a blender. Add remaining 1 cup vegetable broth. Cover and blend until just smooth. Pour into the simmering pot.",
        "Simmer chili gently until bulgur is tender, 15 to 20 minutes."
