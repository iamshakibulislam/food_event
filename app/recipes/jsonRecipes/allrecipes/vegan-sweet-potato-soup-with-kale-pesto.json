        "Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add celery and onion; cook and stir until the vegetables soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Mix in broth, turmeric, ginger, cayenne, cumin, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil.",
        "Pour carefully into a high-speed blender, cover with a lid, and puree on high speed for 1 minute. Add mashed sweet potato and coconut milk; puree until soup has a creamy consistency, about 4 minutes. Add more broth or water if soup is too thick. Cover and keep warm.",
        "Combine kale, walnuts, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper in a blender or food processor.  Process or blend at high speed into a paste, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula as needed, about 3 minutes. Pour in olive oil, one tablespoon at a time, blending after each addition. Add more oil or lemon juice if pesto seems too thick.",
        "Ladle the warm soup into bowls and spoon some pesto on top of each serving."
