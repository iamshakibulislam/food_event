        "Heat margarine in a medium-sized pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until onion is soft and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add caraway seeds, salt, and pepper and cook for another minute. Add water and mix in bouillon. Bring soup to a boil, about 5 minutes. Add potatoes, adjusting water as needed to cover potatoes by a few inches. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until potatoes are soft, but not mushy, 15 to 20 minutes.",
