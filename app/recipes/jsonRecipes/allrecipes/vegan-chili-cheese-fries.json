        "Wash potatoes and remove any discoloration or eyes. Do not peel. Slice evenly into shoestring-style fries or use a French fry cutter. Put the fries into a large bowl and rinse with cool water until water runs clear. Cover fries with 1 inch of water. Cover and let stand for 30 minutes.",
        "Place TVP in a bowl. Cover with hot vegetable broth.",
        "Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, and celery; cook and stir until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in garlic. Add the TVP and broth. Stir in tomatoes, drained beans, molasses, chili powder, oregano, cumin, paprika, smoked salt, and pepper. Simmer until thickened, about 15 minutes.",
        "Preheat an air fryer to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C). Drain the soaked potatoes and dry with a clean towel. Place them back in the bowl, drizzle in 1 tablespoon olive oil, and toss to coat.",
        "Cook in the air fryer, untouched, for 18 minutes. Shake and cook for 6 minutes. Shake again and cook for another 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.",
        "Combine vegan Cheddar, soy milk, and vegan butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave at 360W for 30 seconds. Stir and check the consistency. Add more soy milk and microwave for another 30 seconds, if needed. Stir briskly to create a creamy sauce.",
        "Place the fries on a large platter. Top with chili. Pour the faux cheese sauce over the chili. Top with onion, jalapeno rings, and cilantro."
