        "Warm olive oil in large, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add carrots, celery, and onion and cook, stirring only occasionally, until lightly browned in spots and starting to get tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook 1 minute more.",
        "Add broth, herbes de Provence, bay leaves, and black pepper to the pot with the vegetables and bring to a boil. Simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes.",
        "While broth simmers, bring a pot of well-salted water to a boil and cook noodles until tender but still firm to the bite, about 7 minutes or according to package directions. Drain and toss noodles with a small amount of oil to prevent sticking.",
        "Remove soup from heat and stir in chickpeas, parsley, and lemon juice. Ladle soup into bowls, adding noodles to each bowl right before serving."
