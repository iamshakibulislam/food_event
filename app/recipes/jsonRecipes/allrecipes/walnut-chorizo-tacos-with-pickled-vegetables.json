        "Meanwhile, to prepare \"chorizo\" crumble, place walnuts and beans in a food processor; pulse until coarsely chopped. Add 2 tablespoons oil and remaining crumble ingredients to food processor and pulse again until mixture is finely chopped and resembles ground meat, stirring several times and moving the mixture from the bottom of the food processor bowl to the top to evenly mix.",
        "Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a very large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add \"chorizo\" mixture to skillet and cook for 10 minutes or until mixture is nicely browned and resembles ground meat, stirring frequently.",
        "Brush each tortilla lightly with oil or coat with cooking spray. Cook briefly on a griddle or skillet over medium-high heat to brown on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Keep tortillas warm in foil until ready to serve.",
        "Remove pickled vegetables from liquid and discard garlic slices. Fill each tortilla with equal amounts of \"chorizo\" and pickled vegetables. Garnish with lettuce and cilantro and serve with lime wedges."
