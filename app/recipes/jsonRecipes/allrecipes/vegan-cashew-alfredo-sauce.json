        "Soak cashews in 1 1/2 cups water until softened in a bowl, at least 20 minutes.",
        "Drain water; add almond milk. Blend mixture in an electric blender or food processor until smooth, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add water until sauce is slightly thinner than you want it for the final product, as it thickens when heated. Add garlic, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, salt, and pepper; blend until smooth.",
        "Pour mixture into a saucepan. Heat on medium-low heat, stirring occasionally until heated through and desired thickness is achieved, about 5 minutes. You can add additional water or almond milk if sauce becomes too thick."
