        "Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Drop in a cumin seed to test the heat; if it sizzles, it is hot enough. Add cumin seeds and cook until they begin to crackle, about 1 minute. Add bananas and sliced garlic. Cook until bananas are browned on both sides, about 3 minutes. Transfer bananas to a bowl.",
        "Heat remaining oil in a skillet over medium-high heat and cook onions until soft and starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add minced garlic and butter beans and cook until butter beans are warmed through, about 2 minutes. Add bananas and curry paste. Stir thoroughly, but try not to mash the bananas. Pour in coconut milk and cook on medium-low heat until thickened, about 15 minutes. Add cilantro and cook for 5 minutes more."
