        "Fill a large, shallow container with cold water. Soak rice paper, 1 at a time, until pliable, about 10 seconds. Lay softened rice paper on a plate, rough side up. Scoop a heaping tablespoon of filling near an edge of the rice paper. Fold left and right edges in toward the center, then fold top and bottom edges in to create a large dumpling. Repeat with remaining rice paper and filling.",
        "Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Brush remaining sesame oil onto the insert to keep dumplings from sticking. Bring water to a boil. Add dumplings, cover, and steam until tender, about 3 minutes."
